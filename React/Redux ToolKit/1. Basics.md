# Redux Toolkit

- there are too many unecessary steps to follow in-order to create applications with redux
- since most developers are lazy and they want to bring up the productivity and they want to save time:
- they create Redux Toolkit.
- overall summary of the toolkit link:

## createSlice

simple steps will make your life much easier

- things that have changed from vanilla redux:

  - now you don't need to make reducer that contains many line with if/ifelse or switch

    #### necessary info

          - createSlice takes an **object** as a parameter
          - these are 3 essential components, when making a function createSlice

          1. name (name of the slice), also (you always had to provide names by creating actionCreate, but not anymore;

          by stating "name" it will autogenerates name for you!)

          2. initialstate (initialstate needed like old times)

          3. reducers(you will be making functions)(each functions will take parameter with **state**,**action**)

          (Also, you don't need to put **return** or **...state** anymore,

          you only need to put whatever you want to change as an output)

```jsx
const productSlice = createSlice({
  name: "product",
  initialstate,
  reducers:{
    getAllProducts(state, action){
        state.productList= action.payload.data   //<--- two things that you've noticed: no more **return** & **...state**
                                                 //(automatically takes care of immutability)
    }
    getSingleProducts(state, action){
        state.selectedItem = action.payload.data
    }
  }
});

console.log("ppp", product)
export default product.slice.reducer (without "s")
```

- this is what you can findout by consoleLog(product)

## configureStore

- if you are an early user of redux, you may have found yourself using **createStore** from whereever you store, but since react has brought an upgrade, now we are going to use **configureStore()** instead.

1. you need to import configureStore from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
2. before, when you used createStore, you needed to write
   - combinereducer
   - thunk
   - applyMiddleware
   - composeWithDevTools
     from your store page.
     (you can omit all these out from the list) by using configureStore

```jsx
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    auth: authenticateReducer,
    product: productReducer, //(you need to import theses two into the store page)(no more combinereducers)
  },
});

export default store;
```

## Action Dispatch

1.  since the update, dispatching an action was like: dispatch({}) <-- looking something like this

- now you will be using informations from createSlice, so you would need to export stuffs that you need:
  1. export const productActions = productSlice.actions
  ```jsx
  2. dispatch(productActions.getAllProducts({data})
  <--- by stating productActions. toolkit will auto create lists of functions you made from the reducers.
  ```
  - one thing that you noticed is that getAllProducts() , inside the parameter, it's empty, so in this case, **payload** will be taking place **without** physically writing "payload", all we have to do is to write a data that's taking place under payload. (as a subgroup of an info that we want to sendout.)
