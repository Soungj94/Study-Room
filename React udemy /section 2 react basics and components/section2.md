##building interactive & scalable UIs

module content

1. react core syntax/ and / JSX
2. working with component
3. working with Data

####react is all about components
: because all user interfaces are made up of components

####what could be a components?
reusable bulding blocks in user interface

- it could categorized by smaller components that makes the whole.
  (reusability) (separation of concerns)

- how exactly is a component built?
  basically adding html+ css+ JS makes up react

####react allows us to make reusable and reactive components

- by using declarative approach. (선언적방식 ) - define the desired target states and let react figure out the actual JS DOM instruction
  which element from the actual webpage might need to be added removed or updated...
  i need to define end states and which condition which states should be used, react does the rest.

**jsx**
